* Welcome to EASY - Evented Accounting Sourced from Yaml

=Easy= is a command line utility which generates artifacts typically
used in accounting based on events provided as YAML files.

Each YAML file contains one or more events.

Some of the fields are optional some are mandatory. See [[src/easy/event.cljs][the Spec for
details.]]

** Example YAML file

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
---
- type: revenue
  date: 2017-12-04
  customer: 6
  number: 2
  version: 1
  deadline: 30
  items:
    - rate: 200
      hours: 13.5
      beneficiary: phil
      discount: 0
      timesheet: path/to/timesheet.csv
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Setup

Easy runs on [[http://lumo-cljs.org/][lumo]] and uses node packages available via npm as well as
ClojureScript packages available via clojars/maven.

Hence you will need to install the npm dependencies via =npm install=.

ClojureScript dependencies are installed via a =deps.edn= and =clj=
(aka. CLI). Please install =clj= as described [[https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli][here]].

** Usage

*** Example

=easy example.yml | ledger bal -f -=
